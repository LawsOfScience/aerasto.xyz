        <h1>Hello!</h1>

        <p>
            I'm <strong>Aerasto</strong>. You may also know me as <strong>Klearness</strong> or <strong>LawsOfScience</strong>.
            <br />
            Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I currently am
            <ul>
                <li>An undergraduate studying Computer Science</li>
                <li>
                    A developer for <a href="https://www.roblox.com/groups/2847031/Quantum-Science-Inc#!/about">Quantum Science</a>
                    (yes I know it's a Roblox group)
                </li>
                <li>
                    An aspiring home-labber (I have a Dell PowerEdge R710, just not much to do with it...)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Skills/Interests</h3>
        <p>
            I am interested in <em>low-level programming</em> (i.e. operating systems and Gameboy Advance development),
            as well as <em>back-end development</em>.
            I've made a few APIs and Discord bots, but most of those are in private repositories and <em>probably</em> can't
            be open-sourced. I want to venture into app development too, even if only to expand my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy Linux as well as programming in Rust (my beloved), TypeScript/JavaScript (not as much but still like it),
            and C/C++ (mostly for robotics). I'm also journeying into C# because I've wanted to for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also enjoy anime, Webtoons, and bread making! If you've never made bread before, try it at least once.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact/Links</h2>
        <p>
            I do have a GitHub account, but most of my work is in private repositories. I'm trying to work on
            more projects that I can make public, but I don't have a lot of ideas (always open for suggestions) or time.
